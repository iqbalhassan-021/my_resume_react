                    <p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
                </strong>
                <p>The project was about a wedding site where I was developing a
                    website for the Imperative Technologies, it was an remote based job I
                    also got paid for that. I was the only person tha was working on the
                    project. The client needs a website to share her wedding details and
                    hold the record of guests. After the completion client was happy about
                    it and I leaned new things for example
                    <strong>
                        <p>Client Expectations and Time Management: </p>
                    </strong>
                    Managing client expectations, deadlines, and project scope required
                    effective communication and time management skills. I learned to
                    prioritize tasks, set achievable milestones, and communicate progress
                    transparently.
