            <strong><p>INTRODUCTION:</p></strong>
            <p>The project was about a wedding site where I was developing a 
                website for the Imperative Technologies, it was an remote based job I 
                also got paid for that. I was the only person tha was working on the 
                project. The client needs a website to share her wedding details and 
                hold the record of guests. After the completion client was happy about 
                it and I leaned new things for example 
              <strong><p>Client Expectations and Time Management: </p></strong>   
                Managing client expectations, deadlines, and project scope required 
                effective communication and time management skills. I learned to 
                prioritize tasks, set achievable milestones, and communicate progress 
                transparently. </p>
